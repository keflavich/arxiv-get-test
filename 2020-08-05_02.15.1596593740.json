The\ntheory has been checked successfully against air shower data in two subsequent\npapers (Stanev, Biermann, Gaisser, 1992 preprint; Rachen, Stanev, Biermann,\n1992 preprint)."}, "authors": ["Peter L.

We propose that cosmic rays originate mainly in\nthree sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the approximately homogeneous\ninterstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot\nspots of powerful radio galaxies. The predictions based on this proposition\nhave been tested successfully against airshower data over the particle energy\nrange from 10 TeV to 100 EeV. The low energy cosmic ray particles carried out\nby galactic winds to the intergalactic medium may ionize and heat this medium\nconsistent with all known constraints.

We conclude that shock\nbounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce\nsubstructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the\nsound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab\nthickness."}, "authors": ["ET Vishniac"], "author_detail": {"name": "ET Vishniac"}, "author": "ET Vishniac", "links": [{"title": "doi", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/174231", "rel": "related", "type": "text/html"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9306025v2", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9306025v2", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_comment": "aastex, 42 pages, 9306025", "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "astro-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "astro-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9306025v2", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9306025v2", "journal_reference": null, "doi": "10.1086/174231"}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9306026v1", "guidislink": true, "updated": "1993-06-25T06:49:00Z", "updated_parsed": [1993, 6, 25, 6, 49, 0, 4, 176, 0], "published": "1993-06-25T06:49:00Z", "published_parsed": [1993, 6, 25, 6, 49, 0, 4, 176, 0], "title": "N-Body Simulations of Star-Disc Captures in Globular Clusters", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=cat%3Aastro-ph&id_list=&start=0&max_results=500&sortBy=relevance&sortOrder=descending", "value": "N-Body Simulations of Star-Disc Captures in Globular Clusters"}, "summary": "The presence of protostellar disks can greatly increase the dissipation\nduring close stellar encounters, leading to the formation of a significant\npopulation of binaries during the initial collapse and virialization of a\ncluster.

The \\co-line emission was\ndetected from the dark clouds using the Nobeyama 45m telescope, and the virial\nmass of individual clouds was estimated to be about 10E6 solar masses. The CO\nintensity-to-virial mass ratio is anomalously small, and so is the color\nexcess-to-mass ratio, which indicates a low temperature and a small amount dust\nper unit gas mass in the cloud, respectively. This implies that the molecular\nclouds in the central few hundred pc of M31 are more primeval, suggesting a low\nstar-formation and low dust supply. We propose a possible scenario for the\norigin of the face-on spiral containing such gas on the basis of a ram-pressure\naccretion model of stripped gas clouds from the companion galaxies.

Optimal means maximum\nsignal-to-noise (s/n) for stellar objects. We derive formulae for four\napplications: 1) object detection via matched filter, 2) object detection\nidentical to DAOFIND, 3) aperture photometry, and 4) ALLSTAR profile-fitting\nphotometry. We have included examples involving 21 frames for which either the\nsky brightness or image resolution varied by a factor of three. The gains in\ns/n were modest for most of the examples, except for DAOFIND detection with\nvarying image resolution which exhibited a substantial s/n increase.

Here we\nshow how commonly used likelihood function techniques can be generalized to\naccount for foreground. Specifically we set some restrictions on the spectrum\nof foreground contamination but allow the amplitude to vary arbitrarily. The\nlikelihood function thus generalized gives reasonable limits on the MBR\nanisotropy which, in some cases, are not much less restrictive than what one\nwould get from more detailed modeling of the foreground. Furthermore, the\nlikelihood function is exactly the same as one would obtain by simply\nprojecting out foreground contamination and just looking at the reduced data\nset. We apply this generalized analysis to the recent medium angle data sets of\nACME-HEMT and MAX.

We\nalso check the effects of dynamical evolution and redshift space distortions.\nWe find that clustering of DM particles exhibits deviations from the\nhierarchical scaling, which decrease somewhat in redshift space. Galaxies\nfollow hierarchical scaling far more closely, with coefficients S_3=2.5 and\nS_4=7.5, in general agreement with observational results, just marginally\naffected by redshift distortions and on the choices for the initial spectra.\nThe hierarchical scaling of galaxy clustering is confirmed by the VPF analysis\nand in all the cases considered a good agreement with observational results is\nobtained."}, "authors": ["S.

We find that CHDM\nremains a promising model, with for example $v_{\\rmgr}(0.45) \\approx 125 \\pm 25\n\\kms$ in agreement with the CfA data, while CDM with bias b=1.0\n(COBE-compatible) or b=1.5, both giving $v_{\\rm gr}(0.45) \\approx 400 \\pm 25\n\\kms$, can be virtually ruled out. Using median $M/L$, the observed value of\n$\\Omega$ is $0.10$ (CHDM) to $0.38$ (CDM)."}, "authors": ["Richard Nolthenius", "Anatoly Klypin", "Joel R. Primack"], "author_detail": {"name": "Joel R.

We\npropose that the SGR is an isolated pulsar with both a steady and impulsive\nrelativistic particle wind and these two together power the nebula. We note\nthat both this SGR and SGR 0526-66 are offset from the centers of their SNRs\nwhich requires high space motion of the pulsar. We suggest that some natal\nmechanism produces high velocity and induces SGR activity."}, "authors": ["S. R. Kulkarni", "D. A. Frail", "N. E. Kassim", "T. Murakami", "G.

The instabilities\nare globally coherent in the entire unstable region of the disk and, depending\non the viscosity parameters, the time variability of the mass accretion rates\nare manifested as periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations. We show that, the\nlow frequency ($\\sim 0.04$~Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) discovered\nrecently in some of the black hole candidates (Cyg~X-1 and GRO~J0422+32) and a\nlow mass X-ray binary (Rapid Burster MXB~1730--335) may be explicable by the\nthermal-viscous instabilities in accretion disks. The observations of QPOs\nplace constraints on the viscosity parameters and suggest that $(n,\\alpha_0)$\n$\\sim (1.6,30)$ for the Rapid Burster with a $1.4\\,\\msun$ neutron star. In the\ncase of black hole candidates, the dependence of $\\alpha$ on $h/r$ is less\nsteep corresponding to $n \\sim 1.2-1.3$ for black holes less than $10\\,\\msun$."}, "authors": ["Xingming Chen", "Ronald E.

Carr & Lacey (1987) have\nderived the permissible properties of such systems, and proposed the existence\nof dark clusters with mass of order $10^6\\solarmass$ to explain some of the\nobserved dynamical properties of the stellar disk of the Galaxy. A population\nof bound systems with mass of $\\sim 10^5-10^6\\solarmass$ is also an attractive\npossibility since it is close to the baryon Jeans mass at recombination, which\nmay be the preferred mass scale for the first bound objects to form in the\nuniverse.
